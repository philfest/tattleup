Windup-web
=====================
A servlet front-end for JBoss Windup. Build and install the Windup maven projects separately. 
Requires the jad decompiler (http://www.varaneckas.com/jad/) to be installed and available to the container via PATH. 

How do I run Windup-web?
Deploy windup.war to Tomcat7 and then point your browser to the /windup context. 

There are a couple of caveats:

1. Be sure Tomcat explodes the war or you won't be able to write files.

2. Currently, you will need to create a separate context under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps named /windup-output.
This is done so that the output will not be destroyed with a fresh deploy of windup.war.
