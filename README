Tattleup
=====================

What is Tattleup?
A servlet front-end for JBoss Windup and JBoss Tattletale. You may need to build and install the Windup maven projects separately. 

Windup requires the jad decompiler (http://www.varaneckas.com/jad/) to be installed and available to the container via PATH. 

The tattletale jar is available from the JBoss Maven repo and will be pullled into this project via its POM.

How do I run Tattleup?
Deploy windup.war to Tomcat7 (or any servlet spec 3.x aware container) and point your browser to the /windup context. 

Be sure Tomcat explodes the war or the app won't be able to write files!
